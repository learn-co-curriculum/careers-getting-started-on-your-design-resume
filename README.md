# Getting Started On Your Design Resume

Your resume is the main way of catching the attention of a recruiter or hiring manager. It is the vehicle that you use to tell your story and to outline your strengths that enable you to contribute to the success of the company. A resume highlights your skills, achievements and experience. Think of it as your proxy, as well as a critical component in crafting your personal brand. What do you want this piece of paper to say about you when you can’t be there to say it yourself?

By keeping your resume concise, it gives a preview of what you can do without giving your full story away. You want to highlight just enough to entice your potential employer to call you for more information.

Your resume will explain in a direct but visually interesting way how you got to where you are today. Not why, just how. It's direct because you don’t have the space to get into the why.

When we talk about creating a résumé, we really mean two important and equal halves: 

- Writing your résumé
- Designing your résumé

Doing one well doesn’t guarantee doing the other one well, so they require both sides of the skills  you’ve practiced thus far.
